# Bad Burritos

This repository contains all the necessary files to run the student-developed game Bad Burritos. Run the .html file on some form of server (this can include vscode's "live server" extension and other local web server tools), and everything should work well. You can also visit softwaregalore.github.io to play. The original game has also been partially integrated with the Crazygames Ad SDK, hence the ad placeholders.

# About

Bad Burritos was developed in the 2022-2023 school year to compete in FBLA's Animated Video Game competition, which it took 2nd place in nationally. As with many early videogame attempts, this is a 2D platformer with a twist. Although many of its core game mechanisms are generic, here is a list of its unique features:
- Integrated level editing
  - Export, and import custom designed levels
  - GUI for editing levels
- Unique "burrito killing" mechanics
  - Trees (knocked onto burrito)
  - Ice (frozen burrito)
  - Lime (rolled onto burrito)
  - Spike (fall onto burrito)
- Fully developed "final boss" with dynamically changing music (E.g. the music changes as you progress through the battle)
- Differing terrain
  - Regular grass
  - Stone (same as grass, different visuals)
  - "sour cream", more slippery
  - "bubble gum", more friction, can temporarilly grab onto and wall jump from
  - Moving platforms
  - Lava/spikes
- Tutorial level with guide
