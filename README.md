# BadBadBurritos
The revised version of the student-made game "Bad Burritos". Tacos don't like burritos, and burritos don't like tacos. Instead of jumping on enemies to kill them like in mario, you "trigger" other elements to do so, like kicking down a tree, or hitting down a stlagmite from a cave.
